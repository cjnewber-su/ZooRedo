Walk through the submarine cave to learn how life forms changed over time and explore present day habitats of the plants and animals that live here. Stop at the cave entrance to check out the aquarium holding the only giant Pacific octopus in upstate New York, and several different species of fish, sea stars and anemones.</div>
