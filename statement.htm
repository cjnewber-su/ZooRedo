<p>My inspiration for this project was the Memphis Zoo website. Their website has an easy navigation system with a beautiful backdrop and masterful use of transparecy. I wanted to go for the same look, except with my own spin on it. I went with a light-blue/green color scheme on this project, I believe that they are the most zoo-themed colors out there (green=land, blue=water). </p> <p> Additionally, I wanted the design to be visually pleasing to the eye, which is why I utilized rounded-corders, simple fonts, and transparency. </p> <p> I included in my design the elements from the previous website that would promote my goals of attendance, money, and conservation. By including what I did on the main page (kids activities, volunteering, and conservation), everything there has a purpose to serve one of those three goals. </p>


<p> There are things that I did that I believe deserve points for ambition. First I utilized a 4K Video as my background for the entire website. It required html and CSS coding that we did not actually learn in class. Additionally, I embedded working social media links at the bottom of every page of the website. Also, I was able to create popup window links for the zoo areas. Finally, I created a close-window button for those popup pages </p>
