	<div class="boxtext"> Your next stop is a visit to the animals in Adaptation. As many of these animals are nocturnal, this section of the zoo is frequently referred to as the "dark" area.  Here you will learn about various animals that have inherited unique features over time, which help them survive and reproduce including sloths, clouded leopards, fennec fox, naked mole rats and North American river otters.</div>
